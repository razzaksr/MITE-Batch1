MITE - Batch 1

Greedy
Divide and Conquer
Dynamic Programming

1. Read the item names from kart which is size of 10 in array


Initialize array with SIZE = 10
DISPLAY array[index]
Repeat index 1 to 10



2. Consider the array contains 10 employees annual salary, now you gonna update take home after income tax deduction on each
eg:
[12.5,9.2,4.5,19.5,2.5,56.8]
10.6, 9.10, 4.47, 15.6, 2.5, 39.76

no tax upto 4
4-8>> 5, 8-12>> 10, 12-16>> 15, 16-20>>20, 20-24>>25, 24>> 30
eg: 12.5 - (12.5*0.15) or 12.5*15/100 - 12.5



Day2:

1. Equilibrium Index of account balance in that day you can see the balances of past and post are equals

int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 10, 10, 10, 30, 20, 10, 10};
System.out.println(equilibriumIndex(arr)); // Output: Can't find Equilibrium day
int[] myStatement = {-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0};
day is : 3

2. Array rotation
Array rotation clock and anti-clock
rotation: 2
original:
    0         1         2      3             4          5          6                                                                              
[Node, Django, Vue, Express, Spring, Flask, Angular, 
    7           8
React, Hibernate]
anti-clock
Vue Express Spring Flask Angular React Hibernate Node Django
clock

3. Finding the maximum sub profit from array of 10 where the revenue of each days mentioned.

eg:
2, -4, 1, 9, -6, 7, -3

4. A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into packets. The chocolate packets here represent an array arr of N number of integer values. The task is to find the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array).
Input:
N = 8
arr = [1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0]
Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0]


5. You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.
A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.
Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.
Example 1:
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
Example 2:
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
Example 3:
Input: s = "OOOO"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.


Lab:
1. String is substring of another or not
2. Twisted Prime number
3. Missing min element
